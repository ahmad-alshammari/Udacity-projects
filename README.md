# Project Overview

Testing using Jasmine

A Udacity FEND project

This project demonstrates browser based testing using Jasmine.


 * All the tests are not dependent on the results of another
 * Callbacks are used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
 * Error handling have been implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
 * All tests are passed

  To run the application successfully, Open index.html in the browser of your choice. It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made. Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
